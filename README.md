  A mod for MySims Kingdom on the Nintendo Switch, enabling debug interactions & cheat menus
</p>
<br>

_Note: All features listed here exist in the latest mod version. Some features may be missing when using previous mod versions._

### Debug Interactions
...for Sims from the Wii game:

- ðŸŸ¢ Teleport Sims & animals to safe position
- ðŸŸ¢ Tell Sims to move
- ðŸ”µ Push Sims
- ðŸŸ  Delete Sims (Sims can be respawned using the **Spawn Menu**)
- ðŸ”´ Advance Sims schedule (starts next quest if available)
- ðŸŸ¢ Force Sims to idle (will interrupt any ongoing interactions & makes the sim idle for a couple of seconds)
- ðŸŸ¢ Force Sims to interact with some objects (for objects that have multiple interactions one will be selected randomly)

### Cheat Menus
...when interacting with bookshelves!

- ðŸŸ¢ "*Unlock bonus clothing*": usually unlocked with button combinations in the pause menu (see [MySims Fandom](https://mysims.fandom.com/wiki/Cheat_Codes_(MySims_Kingdom))ï»¿)
- ðŸŸ¢ "*Give all resources*": will give you 999 of every single resource & item
- ðŸŸ¢ "*Unlock post-game blocks*": unlocks all post-game blocks (like the DJ Booth and Dance Floors)
- ðŸŸ  "*Unlock all story islands*": unlocks all story islands except [Reward Island](https://mysims.fandom.com/wiki/Reward_Island)
- ðŸŸ  "*Unlock reward island*"
- ðŸŸ  "*Lock all islands*": locks all islands except [Capital Island](https://mysims.fandom.com/wiki/Capital_Island)


### Model Swap Menu:

- ðŸŸ¢ give any Sim a makeover! You can mix and match any outfits & heads from existing Sims.
- ðŸŸ¢ also gives you access to the models of the [Shipwreck Cove crew](https://mysims.fandom.com/wiki/Shipwreck_Cove#Island_Residents) and [Beebee](https://mysims.fandom.com/wiki/Beebee)ï»¿


### Spawn Menu:

- ðŸŸ  spawn any Sim on any island!
- ðŸŸ  spawn most animals anywhere you want!

> **Limitations:** Sims that are spawned outside their home island will not have a schedule. This means they will not walk around & interact with anything. I'll fix this as soon as I figure out a solution.


### Custom interactions:

- ðŸŸ¢ "*Harvest All*" for trees: shakes all trees on the island at the same time
- ðŸŸ¢ "*Quick Mine*": skips the searching part of the mining mini-game, just mine away indefinitely!
- ðŸŸ¢ "*Quick Fishing*": the location of the fish is marked with game objects. Also, you can't fail this mini-game, just press A as soon as bobber is inside the marked area
- ðŸŸ¢ On/Off Toggling of some objects (Campfire, DJ Booth, Dance Floor)

Download the mod & extract the ZIP file into a "KingdomUnlocked" folder.

Continue from here with your platform (Nintendo Switch with CFW or [Ryujinx](https://github.com/GreemDev/Ryujinx)):

### Switch

1. **[SimpleModManager](https://github.com/nadrino/SimpleModManager)** (recommended): put the entire "KingdomUnlocked" folder from the ZIP file on your SD Card into "mods/MySims Kingdom"

## Colour Codes
- ðŸŸ¢**Safe** = you really have to try hard to break things
- ðŸ”µ**Generally Safe** = there is a possibility you may break something, although very slim
- ðŸŸ **Potentially Unsafe** = no game breaking bugs were found during testing, these options may have unexpected side effects
- ðŸ”´**Dangerous** = don't mindlessly use this, this may break your save game permanently
